# applause

This is a very simple tool for spending applause in online performances. It is embedded in a ordinary website. Everyone who has the Website open, hears the handclapping of everyone currently giving applause.

It is based on Javascript (only Framework: [howlerJS](https://howlerjs.com])) and PHP. It stores its state in textfiles and does not require any database.
